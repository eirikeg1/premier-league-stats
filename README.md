# Python statistics project

Uses the premier league fantasy API to fetch premier league data.

*WORK IN PROGESS* - Currently only reads in static data for the season (players, teams, fixtures and
 dates)

## Future plans (in no particular order)
* Train Machine learning models to analyze statistics
* Implement other methods to analyze statistics
* Use external database to store data (locally? Supabase? Something else?)
* Supplement with other APIs to fetch statistics
    * For example OneFutbol's
